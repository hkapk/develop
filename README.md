# Code Refactor Starter Code

This is assignment one for KU Coding Bootcamp. The HTML text was provided and I added semantic elements, added alt text for images, added comments to the code and added a concise title to the page. I ensured that H1, H2, headings, etc., fell into sequential order and ensured that elements follow logical, sequential order.
